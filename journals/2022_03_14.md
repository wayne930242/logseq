- The Concept of Will in Ancient Philosophy: From Plato to Augustine
  Speaker: Dr. [[Christoph Horn]]
	- Three concepts
		- individual inclination
		- decisionist
		- dynamic
	- History
		- *boulesis* Plato: higher and rational desire (in deliberate sence)
			- anachronism
		- Stoicism: rational tendency (present in every agent, but fully developed only in the wise man)
			- Crysippus: harmony is "will of the administrator of the universe"
				- voluntas: Cicero and Seneca
		- Aristotle: the agent must be the _arche_ of what is _eph'hemin_
		- Augustine:
			- God should not be considered as the origin of the evil in the world
			- decisionist concept of will: the question of what is at our disposition has changed its framework from a eudaemonist context to a theological one
			- will is described as the only conceivable cause for the perverse redirection of human beings (as a faculty that can only be used with full consciousness)
			- will is a constantly conscious faculty to keep or release access to the higher reality and that will is always our disposition.
			- from state to making sin is arbitrarily except for devoting to God
			- 'Augustinian Cogito'
